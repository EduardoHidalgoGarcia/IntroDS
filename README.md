### Summary

In this workshop series named A crash course in Python for Data Science, we will be working with data.

The data that will be using was extracted from [The World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). The extraction period is from 2000 to the last available date (in most cases 2017). 

A full description of the dataset can be find [here](https://github.com/EduardoHidalgoGarcia/WorldBankData/blob/master/World%20Bank%20Indicators%202000%20-%202018.pdf).
